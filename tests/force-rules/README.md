# Force allocation regression checks

Standalone test target (does not require the engine or Boost):

```text
cmake -S tests/force-rules -B build/force-rules-check
cmake --build build/force-rules-check --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/force-rules-check -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The harness extracts the production synchronization helper, UI cost helper,
force-cost tables and shared loadout validator. Engine cvars/serverinfo are
mocked. It checks map/rule transitions, restart initialization, preservation of
explicit server overrides, duel weapon rules, and 20,000 generated loadouts,
including fully spent allocations. It is not an in-game networking/UI test.

## Live verification

Use matching updated UI and cgame modules. The existing engine-side
`forcechanged`/userinfo ordering fix should also be present.

1. On Public, run `/forceinfo` before changing the loadout on each affected map.
   Compare the advertised weapon rules, `ui_freeSaber`, requested loadout and
   server-applied ranks. Matching max rank and force-disable settings alone
   does not establish that the saber costs should match.
2. Repeat with a fully spent loadout, apply it, respawn, and run `/forceinfo`
   again. Confirm that the server kept the selected ranks.
3. Test paid-to-free and free-to-paid saber rules, map changes, reconnects and
   `map_restart`. Repeat after changing a serverinfo setting unrelated to
   weapons, checking that explicit `EV_SET_FREE_SABER` overrides survive it.
4. Confirm normal Force editing with both `ui_freeSaber` values. Rank-one
   Offense/Defense are free only in free-saber mode; higher ranks keep their
   ordinary costs.
5. For the separate devmap stance/attack report, record `/forceinfo` while
   playing as yourself (not following), before and during the lock. Include
   the map, server mod, saber models and reproduction steps. Offense rank,
   holster state, weapon timer, hand extension and saber lock state are
   relevant; the synchronization patch does not bypass gameplay restrictions.

`ui_freeSaber` is now runtime state rather than an archived preference. Cgame
seeds it from the advertised saber-only rules on initialization/restart and
updates it when the rule inputs change. Explicit server events still override
that default. A mod that does not advertise its rules still needs to send its
free-saber event; the client cannot infer an unadvertised custom rule.
